<h2>How to increase Gaming Performace</h2>
<ul>
<li>Following the above steps</li>
<li>Swipe up from the bottom</li>
<li>Now you will see most of the gaming performance</li>
<li>You have three gaming options- Low power mode, Balanced mode, Pro Gamer mode (By default, the Balanced Mode is active) But if you want competitive gaming performance, turn on Pro Game Mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automatically adjust resolution-&nbsp;</strong>This option may&nbsp;decrease your gameplay frame rate but it will save your device battery life.</p>
<p><strong>Brightness Lock &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Most users turn on the automatic brightness that adjusts the brightness level based on darkness and light, but especially during the gameplay in PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty, the brightness level suddenly decreases which is can disturb your gameplay. In the Game Space application, this feature will disable the automatic brightness level during the gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Smart dual-channel network &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>If you are using WiFi while playing PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty, and if Wi-Fi is not able to provide internet speed correctly then this option will reduce the latency of WiFi using mobile 4G network.</p>
<p><strong>Reject calls &ndash;</strong> Allows you to block your all calls while gaming.</p>
